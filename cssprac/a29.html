			mohan kumar The implementation of the 
			string concatenation operator			is left to the discretion of a Java compiler, as long as the compiler ultimately conforms to The Java™ Language Specification.<!-- <br>  -->For example, the javac compiler may implement the operator with StringBuffer, StringBuilder, or java.lang.invoke.StringConcatFactory depending on the JDK version. The implementation of string conversion is typically through the method toString, defined by Object and inherited by all classes in Java.</p>
